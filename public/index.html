    <h1>Georg's Multiplicity Photography</h1>

    <img src="images/Moto Cross.jpg"/>
    <p>Multiplicity Photography puts multiple images of a (typically) 
      moving object into the same photo. This is achieved by taking 
      multiple photos of the same object (in motion) and merging these 
      photos into a single photo with a photo editor.</p>
      <p>Depending on the speed of the moving object a camera is required
      that is able to take photos at a fast enough frame rate. The above
      sequence of the Moto Cross rider was taken at 60 fps, though adjacent
      images in the final photo are more than 1/60s apart.
      </p>

    <p>The photos should be taken with a tripod to make it easier when
      merging the indivual shots in post production.</p>
