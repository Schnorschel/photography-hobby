    <h1>Georg's Multiplicity Photography</h1>

    <img src="images/Beach_Tennis.jpg"/>
    <p>I am using a Casio EX-F1 still bridge camera that can take up to 60
        images at varying frame rates between one and 60 frames per second.
    </p>
    <img src="images/Erin.jpg"/>
    <p>The above image was taken with an older camera that can take images 
        at up to 5 fps (frames per second) maximum only. The individual shots are not 
        as close together as with the other photos due to the slower frame
        rate.
